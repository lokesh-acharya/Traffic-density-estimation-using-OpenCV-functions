# Traffic-density-estimation-using-OpenCV-functions
A series of work to make analysis of traffic on a road(or any other kind of density you may want to analyse over a background)    
**subtask1**: Using opencv to take top projection of view of roads/highways from CCTV camera footage.  
**subtask2**: Queue and dynamic density estimation from traffic video.    
**subtask3**: Understanding and analyzing trade-offs in software design.
