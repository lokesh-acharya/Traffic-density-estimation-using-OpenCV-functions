|--------make----------|    
To create executables of all the methods run:  
	$ make  
	this create folder "exe" containing all executables  
  
|--------clean----------|  
To remove all executables formed run:  
	$ make clean  
	this removes the entire "exe" folder  
  
|--------run----------|  
To run base method base12.cpp run:  
	$ make run_b12  
	this gives direction to execute the code with video path  
  
Similarly for base34.cpp run:  
	$ make run_b34  
  
To run any method i run:  
	$ make runi  
	this gives direction to execute code with video path and parameter
